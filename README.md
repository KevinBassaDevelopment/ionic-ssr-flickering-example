# ionic-ssr-flickering-example
This example demostrates that ionic ssr has visible flickering when switching between server and browser version

It visualizes the loading process by showing the text "Server" and "Browser" in the app-header and on the page-header, depending of where the content was rendered.

**To see it in detail:**
 
1) npm run build:ssr   (to have prod version with minimum bundle size)
2) npm run serve:ssr
3) open browser, set network speed to slow-3g
4) load localhost:4000
     -> blank page when swapping between server side rendered page and client side rendered page



This Example has been made **in comparison** to the complete same app in angular alone:

In comparison to angular alone, using ionic introduces 2 visible steps when changing from server to browser version.
